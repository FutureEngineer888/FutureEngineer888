# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Step 1: Data Collection
# Assuming you have a CSV file with historical sales data
sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Clean and preprocess the data as needed
# For simplicity, we'll assume the data is already clean

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Perform basic exploratory data analysis
# For example, visualize the sales data over time
plt.plot(sales_data['Date'], sales_data['Sales'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.title('Sales Over Time')
plt.show()

# Step 4: Feature Engineering
# Add relevant features such as lagged variables, seasonality, etc.
# For simplicity, we'll use only the 'Date' feature as a predictor

# Step 5: Model Selection
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sales_data['Date'], sales_data['Sales'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model (Random Forest Regressor)
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train.values.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
# Evaluate the model performance on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test.values.reshape(-1, 1))
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)

# Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning (optional)
# Tune the model hyperparameters as needed

# Step 8: Deployment (optional)
# Deploy the trained model using Flask or Django for real-time forecasting

# Step 9: Documentation
# Provide comprehensive documentation explaining the project's objectives, methodology, and implementation steps

# Step 10: Visualization
# Create visualizations to communicate insights and predictions effectively.
